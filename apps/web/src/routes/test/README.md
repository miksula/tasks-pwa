# Test route — Playground

This folder contains a small playground used for experimenting with UI components, DOM behaviors and quick prototypes. It isn't intended to be part of the main application logic — instead it's a safe place to try ideas, debug animations, test event handling patterns, and experiment with DOM reconciliation or LitElement features.

## Files

- `Test.ts`
	- Route entry point for the playground. When browsing the app, this component is mounted on `/test` and renders the example components below.
- `components/counter-element.ts`
	- A simple LitElement that keeps a local counter and demonstrates dispatching and handling of a `counter-change` event. Useful for testing event bubbling, small interactions and local state handling.
- `components/todo-list.ts`
	- A small list component that listens for `EVENT_DATA` (global state dispatch) and renders a list of todo items. This file contains a custom DOM reconciliation function to reuse, reorder and animate items efficiently — it's an experiment for list rendering optimizations.
- `styles/counter-element.css.ts` and `styles/todo-list.css.ts`
	- Styles scoped to the components above. Keep CSS local here while prototyping.

## How to use

1. Start the dev server (Vite) and open the app in your browser.
2. Visit `/test` to try the playground components in the app UI.
3. To simulate application state updates for the `todo-list`, dispatch a global `EVENT_DATA` event with a `State` payload. Example from the browser console:

```js
dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('EVENT_DATA', {
	detail: {
		tasks: {
			items: [
				{ id: '1', text: 'Sample #1', completed: 0 },
				{ id: '2', text: 'Sample #2', completed: 1 }
			],
			filter: 'all'
		}
	}
}));
```

Alternatively, you can trigger a state load with `dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('EVENT_LOAD'))`, which will cause the app's store to load the state (if configured) and broadcast `EVENT_DATA`.

## Notes & suggestions

- This folder is a good place to add quick POCs before moving code to `shared` components. Keep experiments small and temporary; when a pattern or component becomes production-ready, move it to a suitable shared folder and add tests.
- Be mindful of event names like `EVENT_DATA` and `EVENT_ACTION` — they are defined in `src/shared/constants.ts` and used throughout the app's store for broadcasting updates.
- If you're experimenting with list rendering or DOM algorithms (like the one in `todo-list.ts`), prefer unit tests or tiny visual test cases under `test/` before promoting them to core features.

Happy prototyping! 🎉
